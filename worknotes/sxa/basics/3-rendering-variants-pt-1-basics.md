<summary>Rendering Variants - Part 1 - The Basics</summary>
<br />  

*Within SXA, you can use partial and page designs to create your UX layout.*

After datasource architecture, partial and page designs is a likely first step. Follow this path ```sitecore > Content > *my_tenant_name* > *my_site_name* > Presentation > Page || Partial Designs```. Partial Designs, i.e. a Header or Footer, are combined to create a Page Design. Right-click on ```Partial Designs``` then find ```Insert > Partial Design```. In the partial design wizard, give your partial design a name, i.e. Header, then click ok. Your new partial design will appear in the folder tree, right-click on that then click ```Experience Editor```, this will open the *Experience Editor*.

Within the *Experience Editor* you can drag and drop components into your partial design. In the *Experience Editor*, you will see (in the main part of the screen) a field that looks like a canvas (grey and white checkboard patterned), this is where the components for your partial design will go. There is a *header*, a *main*, and a *footer* for each partial design and when the page is rendered, these sections will be rendered in that order. For example, if you are making a Header component, but place the components for the partial design in a section that is not the header, then your Header Partial Design will not render in the header of your page.
