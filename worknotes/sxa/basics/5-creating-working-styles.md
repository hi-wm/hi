Within the *Style Definition*, whatever is typed in the *Value* field will be the class name (see above *Value* background-color-dg). This *Style Definition* will now be available to apply to components when you are working on a page in the *Experience Editor*. Simply click the component you would like to apply the style to, when the component editor window appears, click *More* then *Edit component properties*
