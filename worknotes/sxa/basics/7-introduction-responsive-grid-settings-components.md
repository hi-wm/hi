<summary>Introduction to Responsive Grid Settings for Components</summary>

Jumping right in... in the *Experience Editor* turn on the *Grid*, it is under the *VIEW* tab at the top of the *Experience Editor*. Then, back in the canvas section of the *Experience Editor*, you will see the grid when you click on a section of the page i.e. header, main, footer.

The columns shown above are the grid. There are likely to always be 12 columns. These columns are used to lay out components and content. You will need to tell the components how much space they are allowed to take, i.e. how many columns wide they can be. Add a *Rich Text* component to the main area of your canvas. Add some lorem ipsum placeholder text to your *Rich Text* component. Hit save in the upper right-hand corner of the *Experience Editor*. If you do not hit save and start making adjustments to the grid settings for your component, it is possible that your changes will be lost and no one wants that, except for the *Experience Editor*... Anyway, it is always good practice to save. With your component selected, click *More* on the component editor panel, then *Edit component properties* to bring up the component properties dialogue window.
