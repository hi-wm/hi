<!-- *What are Rendering Variants and when should you use them?*

In Sitecore, most of the pages that display content can be rendered using *Rendering Variants*. In your project folder tree, look at ```sitecore > Templates > Project > Tenant > Blog Post```. Here you can *Build* a template that can be used to structure your blog posts.

If you open a Blog Post in the sitecore *Experience Editor*, you can drop a *Page Content* component into the main section of the blog post (find this component in the *PAGE CONTENT* section of available components on the right-hand side of the *Experience Editor*). By default, the *Page Content* component will use the first found rendering variant. To make a new *Rendering Variant* definition, check the screenshot below.
