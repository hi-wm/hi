<summary>SXA Partial and Page Design Basics</summary>
<br />  

*Within SXA, you can use partial and page designs to create your UX layout.*

After datasource architecture, partial and page designs is a likely first step. Follow this path ```sitecore > Content > *my_tenant_name* > *my_site_name* > Presentation > Page || Partial Designs```. Partial Designs, i.e. a Header or Footer, are combined to create a Page Design. Right-click on ```Partial Designs``` then find ```Insert > Partial Design```. In the partial design wizard, give your partial design a name, i.e. Header, then click ok. Your new partial design will appear in the folder tree, right-click on that then click ```Experience Editor```, this will open the *Experience Editor*.

Within the *Experience Editor* you can drag and drop components into your partial design. In the *Experience Editor*, you will see (in the main part of the screen) a field that looks like a canvas (grey and white checkboard patterned), this is where the components for your partial design will go. There is a *header*, a *main*, and a *footer* for each partial design and when the page is rendered, these sections will be rendered in that order. For example, if you are making a Header component, but place the components for the partial design in a section that is not the header, then your Header Partial Design will not render in the header of your page.

To add a component to the Header, drag the *Navigation* component from the right-hand side of the *Experience Editor* to the header section of the canvas. The *Navigation* component is nested under the *NAVIGATION* category of available components. Once the *Navigation* component is in the header section of the canvas, a toolbar for that component will appear (as seen below).

On the right-side of the toolbar for your placed component, there is a dropdown menu, labeled *More*, underneath which are additional options for your component. Click *More*, then click *Edit component properties* to open the *Control Properties* wizard. When the wizard opens, scroll to the bottom *Styling* section. Here you can change the style of your component. Under *Navigation*, click the *Big/Fat Navigation*, then scroll further to the *Navigation Settings* section of the wizard. In the *Navigation Settings* section of the *Control Properties* wizard you can adjust the levels of navigation. In the demo, the presenter changes the *Bottom Navigation Level* from the default of 2, to 1. Click the little blue *OK* button to save the changes to your component. You should now see a horizontal navigation. Click save.

Back in the main folder tree of your project, right-click on ```Partial Designs``` then find ```Insert > Partial Design```. In the partial design wizard, give your partial design a name, i.e. Footer, then click ok. Your new partial design will appear in the folder tree, right-click on that then click ```Experience Editor```, this will open the *Experience Editor*.

Try inserting a *Rich Text* component into the footer section of your footer partial design. The *Rich Text* component is in the *PAGE CONTENT* section on the right-hand side of the partial design experience editor. Add some basic text, i.e. Â© 2019, then click the save icon in the top-left corner of the *Experience Editor*.

Back in the main folder tree again, in the *Partial Designs* folder of your site you should have a *Footer* and a *Header*. These can now be combined in a *Page Design*. Without a page design, there will be no way to render a page and page designs are dependent on partial designs. So far, the design partials that have been created are only within the header and footer sections of the page, applying those to a page design would still leave the *main* section of a page empty. If you are working on a specific page design layout that requires content to be in the *main* section of a page (show me a page that only has a header and a footer...), then you will need to build some partial designs that have components in the *main* section of them.

In the folder tree, right-click on *Page Designs* and ```Insert > Page Design```. In the *new page design* wizard, enter a name for the new item (the new page design).

Once you have named your new page, you will be presented with options for your new page. Under the *Designing* section, ALL shared *Partial Designs* are available to be selected for the page design. Clicking the name will move them over to the Selected area.

Add your *Header*, *Footer*, and *Metadata* *Partial Designs*, then click the save icon in the upper right-hand corner of the screen. Now, if you follow your website folder tree to; ```Tenant > *site_name* > Home > Page_#``` then right-click and select *Experience Editor*, you will be taken to the Experience Editor for that page.

Leave the *Home* Page alone, but set the *Page* design type to the *Page Design* you have previously created. Save the setting (upper right-hand corner), you should then see the header and footer automatically assigned to your page.
