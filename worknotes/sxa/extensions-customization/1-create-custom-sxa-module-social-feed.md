*It's always better to clone an existing component rather than using it*

It is recommended to clone an existing component because there is a folder structure to a component and it is easier to modify a clone than to make all of the required folders and files from scratch. The component to copy for this tutorial is the *Promo* component. Find the *Promo* component in sitecores folder tree, right-click the name, then ```Scripts > Clone Rendering```.
