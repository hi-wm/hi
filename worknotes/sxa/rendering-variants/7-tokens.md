<!-- Out of the box, the image rendering in sitecore does not provide responsive image field rendering, but it can be set up! Within rendering variants, there is an *Image* type. If you right-click on *Image*, you can set up a *Responsive Image* rendering variant!

The settings in *Sizes* will be determined by UX / FED. Under the hood, sitecore is generating the correct syntax to markup the page to render images responsively. [Check out this link for more information about responsive images](https://alistapart.com/article/using-responsive-images-now). Sitecore will only download the image according to the breakpoint as defined by the source set of images. -->
