Following up on the previous *Rendering Variants* *Blog Post* has been extended. The Author / Single-Line Text has been subbed for Authors / Multiroot Treelist with a dynamic source.

*SXA Rendering Variants Working with References and Links Dynamic Source Example*

To set up the dynamic source for the *Blog Post*, a new folder has been added ```sitecore > Content > *tenant_name* > *site_name* > Data > *new_folder_name*```, in this case the new folder is called *Authors* and a bunch of authors have been added. A new rendering variant is required for this new set of *Data*. To create a new *Rendering Variant* follow this path ```sitecore > Content > *tenant_name* > *site_name* > Presentation > Rendering Variants > Page Content```, right-click on *Page Content* then ```Insert > Variant Definition```. Give your new *Variant Definition* a name.

If you click on your new variant definition, the *Content* window to the right of the folder tree will become active for the new variant definition. Scrolling down the *Content* window, there is a field to add CSS classes to the variant definition, add any classes as needed, separated by a space. Right-click on the name of the new rendering variant and ```Insert > Reference``` to create a reference to a data source. In the video, that name is *Authors*. With the reference set up, the rendering variant can now access the fields from that which it referenced *Authors*. The next step is to add a wrapper around the reference, so right-click on the variant definition and ```Insert > Section```. Name the wrapper as needed, in this case *Header Wrapper*. Manually move the new wrapper under the new reference. Right-click on the new *Header Wrapper* and ```Insert > Field```. Since this variant definition has a reference to another set of *Data*, the fields from within the original source are available. To access the fields from the *Data* source, new fields in the rendering variant should match the names of the fields from the original reference, i.e. if there is a field named 'First Name' in the original *Data* source, then the reference should use the same field name 'First Name' in order to access that data. At this point, if you have references set up correctly, you should be able to test out the rendering variant from within the *Experience Editor* by simply dropping the appropriate component into the *main* section of your page, then selecting the *Variant* that you have been working on. If everything was setup correctly, your rendering variant will display the appropriate content and styling according to how it was set up.

If there are additional fields available from the data source, i.e. an image or additional text or date, continue to add them to the reference, make sure to save the changes, then refresh the page where you are testing the component. Rendering Variants will render as many times as needed per page, as in the instance of this tutorial, if there are 2 or more authors on a *Blog Post*, the rendering variant will apply to each instance of an author. Add the variant to the *Partial Designs* for the page you are working on and it will be used to populate the page as it is set up outside of the *Experience Editor*.
