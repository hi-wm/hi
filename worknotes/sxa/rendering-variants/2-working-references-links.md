*SXA Rendering Variants Working with References and Links Dynamic Source Example*

To set up the dynamic source for the *Blog Post*, a new folder has been added ```sitecore > Content > *tenant_name* > *site_name* > Data > *new_folder_name*```, in this case the new folder is called *Authors* and a bunch of authors have been added. A new rendering variant is required for this new set of *Data*.
